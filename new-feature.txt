A new feature that I think is meaningful to implement in the future is to collect the questions that posted by the users whose questions 
are in the 10 most voted questions. Also, the owner of the most voted answer might also anwer related questions recently. The questions 
they choose to answer are meaningful and worth thinking about to some extent from their point of view. So these questions should also be 
included in. And repeated questions will definitely not  showing again

Although the original 20 questions might seems to be enough for someone who are interested in browsing and answering. It is still possible 
that during some special time like new technical emerge attracts people so that 20 questions can not satisfy the needs. Also, we can 
not deny the value of questions with not so high votes. They can be ignored by people. 

There will be a button on the bottom-right of the website. Users can view extra ones if they want.
